-------
>There are 8 categories in which disabled students are classified according to their disabilities - medical impairment, mental illness, mobility impairment, hearing impairment, learning disability, vision impairment, acquired brain impairment, and intellectual disability. Because certain individuals are physically and mentally challenged, it does not mean that they cannot perform well in the academics or professional life. With the advent of eLearning, education is no longer a laborious work for disabled students.

>In fact, disabled students studying online find it more fulfilling and less difficult to get knowledge. While it is difficult for the disabled students to get admission in a conventional education institution, this is not a case when they turn to online learning platforms.

>As a matter of fact, many colleges and universities have started conducting online learning platforms. Today, the concept of virtual campuses is evolving rapidly and more disabled students are getting enrolled. Technology is also playing a pivotal role in providing the perfect learning solutions to the disabled students. Nowadays, students choose their own location for schoolwork and study.

>Besides, disabled students find it more comforting to study in the online environment as it gives them more time to complete assignments as well as allow them to sit, rest or walk whenever there is a necessity.
